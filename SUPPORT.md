Here are some tips:

*   [Talk to a duck](https://rubberduckdebugging.com)!
*   Donâ€™t fall for the [XY problem](https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/66377/what-is-the-xy-problem/66378#66378)
*   Search to find out if a similar question has been asked
*   Try to define what you need help with:
    *   Is there something in particular you want to do?
    *   What problem are you encountering and what steps have you taken to try
        and fix it?
    *   Is there a concept you donâ€™t understand?
*   Provide sample code, such as a [CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io) or video, if possible
*   Screenshots can help, but if thereâ€™s important text such as code or error
    messages in them, please also provide those as text
*   The more time you put into asking your question, the better we can help you
